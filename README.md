# Merc 01

Merc 01 is a fast paced twin stick shooter built on top of pyglet.

### Behaviour System
The enemies use a pluggable behaviour system (enemies are passed a behaviour array, e.g. `[behaviours.follow, behaviours.repulse, behaviours.delay]`, which I think is pretty cool.

### Some Issues
Game seems to run slowly when playing music (!?) I don't know how to fix this (as I'm only using the API). You can set the option to performance mode if you're having problems.
